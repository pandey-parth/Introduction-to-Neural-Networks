    A building block. Each layer is capable of performing two things:
    
    - Process input to get output:           output = layer.forward(input)
    
    - Propagate gradients through itself:    grad_input = layer.backward(input, grad_output)
    
    Some layers also have learnable parameters which they update during layer.backward.

# ### The road ahead
# 
# We're going to build a neural network that classifies MNIST digits. To do so, we'll need a few building blocks:
# - Dense layer - a fully-connected layer, $f(X)=W \cdot X + \vec{b}$
# - ReLU layer (or any other nonlinearity you want)
# - Loss function - crossentropy
# - Backprop algorithm - a stochastic gradient descent with backpropageted gradients
# 
# Let's approach them one at a time.
# 

# ### Nonlinearity layer
# 
# This is the simplest layer you can get: it simply applies a nonlinearity to each element of your network.

# In[5]:

# #### Instant primer: lambda functions
# 
# In python, you can define functions in one line using the `lambda` syntax: `lambda param1, param2: expression`
# 
# For example: `f = lambda x, y: x+y` is equivalent to a normal function:
# 
# ```
# def f(x,y):
#     return x+y
# ```
# For more information, click [here](http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/lambda_functions.hawk).    

# ### Dense layer
# 
# Now let's build something more complicated. Unlike nonlinearity, a dense layer actually has something to learn.
# 
# A dense layer applies affine transformation. In a vectorized form, it can be described as:
# $$f(X)= W \cdot X + \vec b $$
# 
# Where 
# * X is an object-feature matrix of shape [batch_size, num_features],
# * W is a weight matrix [num_features, num_outputs] 
# * and b is a vector of num_outputs biases.
# 
# Both W and b are initialized during layer creation and updated each time backward is called.

# ### Testing the dense layer
# 
# Here we have a few tests to make sure your dense layer works properly. You can just run them, get 3 "well done"s and forget they ever existed.
# 
# ... or not get 3 "well done"s and go fix stuff. If that is the case, here are some tips for you:
# * Make sure you compute gradients for W and b as __sum of gradients over batch__, not mean over gradients. Grad_output is already divided by batch size.
# * If you're debugging, try saving gradients in class fields, like "self.grad_w = grad_w" or print first 3-5 weights. This helps debugging.
# * If nothing else helps, try ignoring tests and proceed to network training. If it trains alright, you may be off by something that does not affect network training.

# ### The loss function
# 
# Since we want to predict probabilities, it would be logical for us to define softmax nonlinearity on top of our network and compute loss given predicted probabilities. However, there is a better way to do so.
# 
# If you write down the expression for crossentropy as a function of softmax logits (a), you'll see:
# 
# $$ loss = - log \space {e^{a_{correct}} \over {\underset i \sum e^{a_i} } } $$
# 
# If you take a closer look, ya'll see that it can be rewritten as:
# 
# $$ loss = - a_{correct} + log {\underset i \sum e^{a_i} } $$
# 
# It's called Log-softmax and it's better than naive log(softmax(a)) in all aspects:
# * Better numerical stability
# * Easier to get derivative right
# * Marginally faster to compute
# 
# So why not just use log-softmax throughout our computation and never actually bother to estimate probabilities.
# 
# Here you are! We've defined the both loss functions for you so that you could focus on neural network part.

# ### Peer-reviewed assignment
# 
# Congradulations, you managed to get this far! There is just one quest left undone, and this time you'll get to choose what to do.
# 
# 
# #### Option I: initialization
# * Implement Dense layer with Xavier initialization as explained [here](http://bit.ly/2vTlmaJ)
# 
# To pass this assignment, you must conduct an experiment showing how xavier initialization compares to default initialization on deep networks (5+ layers).
# 
# 
# #### Option II: regularization
# * Implement a version of Dense layer with L2 regularization penalty: when updating Dense Layer weights, adjust gradients to minimize
# 
# $$ Loss = Crossentropy + \alpha \cdot \underset i \sum {w_i}^2 $$
# 
# To pass this assignment, you must conduct an experiment showing if regularization mitigates overfitting in case of abundantly large number of neurons. Consider tuning $\alpha$ for better results.
# 
# #### Option III: optimization
# * Implement a version of Dense layer that uses momentum/rmsprop or whatever method worked best for you last time.
# 
# Most of those methods require persistent parameters like momentum direction or moving average grad norm, but you can easily store those params inside your layers.
# 
# To pass this assignment, you must conduct an experiment showing how your chosen method performs compared to vanilla SGD.
# 
# ### General remarks
# _Please read the peer-review guidelines before starting this part of the assignment._
# 
# In short, a good solution is one that:
# * is based on this notebook
# * runs in the default course environment with Run All
# * its code doesn't cause spontaneous eye bleeding
# * its report is easy to read.
# 
# _Formally we can't ban you from writing boring reports, but if you bored your reviewer to death, there's noone left alive to give you the grade you want._
# 
# 
# ### Bonus assignments
# 
# As a bonus assignment (no points, just swag), consider implementing Batch Normalization ([guide](https://gab41.lab41.org/batch-normalization-what-the-hey-d480039a9e3b)) or Dropout ([guide](https://medium.com/@amarbudhiraja/https-medium-com-amarbudhiraja-learning-less-to-learn-better-dropout-in-deep-machine-learning-74334da4bfc5)). Note, however, that those "layers" behave differently when training and when predicting on test set.
# 
# * Dropout:
#   * During training: drop units randomly with probability __p__ and multiply everything by __1/(1-p)__
#   * During final predicton: do nothing; pretend there's no dropout
#   
# * Batch normalization
#   * During training, it substracts mean-over-batch and divides by std-over-batch and updates mean and variance.
#   * During final prediction, it uses accumulated mean and variance.
#
